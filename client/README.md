# The Task App

## A fullstack task app created with React JS with MongoDB Atlas providing the database.

### The goal of this project was to practice using React hooks, in particular the Context API to manage state. I would like to turn this into a start page for myself that displays usefull information such as the weather, sports scores, etc by incorporating some APIs.
